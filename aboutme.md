#### About me

I am a software developer/architect, [speaker](/speaker), [trainer](/trainer), and team leader working primarily with .NET and JavaScript ecosystems. I love learning new things, especially new programming languages and techniques that allow us to build software in a simple way.

My professional career started in 2005, right after I graduated from computer science studies, with an internship and then employment as a .NET programmer. That was when a new .NET 2.0 and VS 2005 were released with the modernized C# 2.0 language. Up to 2012, I had been working with almost all crucial .NET technologies released back then, such as WPF, WCF, WF, EF, LINQ, TPL, Silverlight, Kinect, and XNA. My R&D team had been responsible for designing the architecture and implementing tools and infrastructure for building a new ERP system. After that, we started many smaller products, like applications for Kinect with Xbox, the original Microsoft Surface touch table, and even for Windows Phone. With the growing popularity of Silverlight, we decided to build a programming platform for building multi-tenant SaaS and a new lightweight ERP system based on it. 

In 2012, we entered an entirely new healthcare domain. Our goal was clear: build modern, real-time web and mobile applications for the private and public healthcare sector. After Microsoft abandoned Silverlight technology, we bet on JavaScript. We started working with Node.js, MongoDB, ElasticSearch databases, and the Angular.js framework. That was refreshing after many years of working primarily with .NET technologies. With the JavaScript revolution, we also included other technologies like TypeScript, Angular.io, React, and React Native. Over the years, we have built a modular CMS platform and many different products based on it. One of the more challenging functionalities was a real-time video component working with web and mobile applications using WebRTC. It gained popularity once COVID hit. Of course, we also have been tracing changes in the .NET world. Our old friend, Microsoft, gave us not only the TypeScript language, but also a new cross-platform .NET Core. Thanks to microservice architecture, we could build solutions composed of services based on different technology stacks, choosing the best tool for the job.

In the meantime, I've started my technical [blog](/) and have traveled, giving technical talks at conferences and user groups. Since 2012, I have also been working as a trainer, conducting workshops for developers and architects. Sharing knowledge and interests, as well as teaching others, have always been fulfilling for me.

I am also interested in people. I love building well-trained, highly productive, respectful, and motivated teams. Leadership is a skill we can learn, too.
