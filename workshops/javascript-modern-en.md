# Modern JavaScript

Please register [here](https://www.comarch.pl/szkolenia/programowanie/javascript/nowoczesny-javascript-warsztaty-praktyczne/) or let me know directly
### Description

The course teaches modern JavaScript and TypeScript from scratch. It starts from ES5 and explains crucial elements, such as objects, this, and prototypes, in detail. Then, participants will learn all the features of ES6 and, finally, the most important features of TypeScript. Different programming paradigms will be compared using dedicated code examples, such as object-oriented vs. functional style, static vs. dynamic typing, and declarative vs. imperative programming. The asynchronous and reactive aspects of JavaScript are often the root of complex and hard-to-understand code, which is why participants will learn different techniques to deal with it in detail. 

Duration: 3 days
