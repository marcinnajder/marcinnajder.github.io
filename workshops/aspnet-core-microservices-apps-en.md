# Building microservices with ASP.NET Core

Please register [here](https://www.comarch.pl/szkolenia/programowanie/net-c/aplikacje-mikroserwisowe-w-aspnet-core) or let me know directly
### Description

The training aims to familiarize participants with the main assumptions of microservice architecture and the ASP.NET Core framework used to implement it. Participants will gain practical knowledge in creating their REST and gRPC services. Additionally, they will learn how to test and then deploy microservice applications using Docker containers. The training is conducted through lectures, workshops, and hands-on exercises.

Duration: 3 days
